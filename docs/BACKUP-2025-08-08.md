- ✅ Mapbox maps displaying with new token
- ✅ No more white page issues
- ✅ No more 403 errors from Mapbox

### Key Fixes Applied
1. **Fixed White Page Issue**
   - Removed old Botpress scripts from index.html
   - Fixed server configuration (port 5173 instead of 8080)
   - Added service worker clearing functionality

2. **Fixed Mapbox Token**
   - Updated to new token without URL restrictions
   - Token: `pk.eyJ1IjoidGhhYm9uZWwiLCJhIjoiY205NWUwOXhuMG1nbTJycHV0YWIxZXMweSJ9.oKCsgSBvvlDo56_y3s5f1Q`
   - Maps now load without 403 errors

3. **Server Configuration**
   - Changed from IPv6 `::` to `localhost`
   - Using standard Vite port 5173
   - CORS properly configured

### Environment Variables
```bash
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://ydevatqwkoccxhtejdor.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=[configured]
VITE_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN=pk.eyJ1IjoidGhhYm9uZWwiLCJhIjoiY205NWUwOXhuMG1nbTJycHV0YWIxZXMweSJ9.oKCsgSBvvlDo56_y3s5f1Q
```
